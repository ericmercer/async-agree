Figure \ref{useCaseExample} shows a use example from the UAV AADL model developed in the DARPA CASE project. The UAV software has 13 threads, scheduled in a period of 95 ticks. The schedule model is based on the \emph{seL4} domain schedule used in the implementation. Four system-level security properties were proved in less than 2 minutes.
