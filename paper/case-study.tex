In the DARPA CASE project, a suite of tools were developed to help system engineers to design cyber-physical systems that must satisfy cyber-resiliency requirements.
For demo purposes, we modelled a UAV system. The target application is waterway monitor. The waterway area consists of a set of fly-in zones and fly-out zones. The goal of the UAV is to fly from one end of the waterway to the other end in minimum distance, while staying inside the fly-in zones and outside the fly-out zones.
 
Figure \ref{SW} shows an overview of the software architecture. The UAV software origally contains 5 threads: UxAS, waypoint plan manager, UART driver, radio driver, and fly zone database. They are associated with various levels of trustworth. For example, the UxAS thread, used as a blackbox software component, was deemed as potentially security-compromised.
By applying the CASE tools, some security vunerabilities were identified. Then the user was guided by the tools to invoke a series of model transformations to address the issues. The transformation inserted 8 threads (assurance components): attestation gate, attestation manager, 2 monitors, and 4 filters. The verification goal is to prove that the key system security properties are satisfied after the transformation.  

The seL4 microkernel was chosen as part of the implementation platform. A seL4 domain schedule was created to execute the 13 threads on a single processor. All threads are periodic with a period of 500 ms. Each thread is activated exactly once in the scheduling cycle. The allocated execution time for each thread ranges from 2 ms (filter/monitor) to 100 ms (UxAS).
Four system-level security properties were proved in less than 2 minutes on a PC with 2.6 GHz CPU and 32 GB RAM.
