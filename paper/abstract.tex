%AGREE is an AADL-based compositional verification framework used in safety-critical applications. It
%is based on a synchronous model of computation (simultaneous execution). However, in the
%implementation, the components of a system are often executed in a sequential order (e.g. defined by
%a static cyclic schedule), due to the sharing of computational resources. 
Contract-based assume-guarantee reasoning can be used to improve the scalability of model checking
by decomposing complex verification problems.  In previous work, we have demonstrated this approach 
for systems modeled using the Architecture Analysis and Design Language (AADL) assuming a 
synchronous model of computation.  This allows nondeterministic ordering of parallel components
and generally results in an overapproximation of real behavior.  
This paper describes an
approach to incorporating an execution schedule in the assume-guarantee reasoning. We define our semantic
interpretation of contracts when components are executed according to this schedule, 
more accurately reflecting the behavior of the system implementation. 
We introduce virtual scheduling events which tie AADL timing and execution semantics to contracts. 
A case study based on a simple unmanned air vehicle surveillance system is provided to illustrate our approach.
