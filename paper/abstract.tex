AGREE is an AADL-based compositional verification framework used in safety-critical applications. It is based on a synchronous model of computation (instantaneous and simultaneous execution). This deviates from the AADL asynchronous semantics, where threads (mapped to a single processor) are executed in a sequential order (e.g. defined by a schedule) and communicate asynchronously (e.g. bounded FIFOs associated with event data ports). In this paper, we extend the AGREE framework to comply with these AADL semantics. We introduce virtual scheduling events, which tie AADL timing and scheduling semantics to AGREE contracts. This enhancement enables AGREE to preserve the AADL semantics and take the software execution schedule into account in the analysis. 
%This work was implemented and demonstrated in the DARPA CASE project.
