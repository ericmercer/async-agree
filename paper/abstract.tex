AGREE is an AADL-based compositional verification framework used in safety-critical applications. It is based on a synchronous model of computation (instantaneous and simultaneous execution). However, the actual software and hardware components are often executed in a sequential order (e.g. defined by a static cyclic schedule), due to the sharing of computational resources. This paper describes an approach to incorporating a schedule in the assume-guarantee reasoning. We introduce virtual scheduling events, which tie AADL timing and execution semantics to AGREE contracts. A case study based on the models developed in the DARPA CASE project is provided to illustrate our approach.
