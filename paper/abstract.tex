AGREE is an AADL-based compositional verification framework used in safety critical applications. It is based on a synchronous model of computation (instantaneous and simultaneous execution). This deviates from the AADL native semantics, where threads (mapped to a single processor) are executed in a sequential order (e.g. defined by schedule) and communicate asynchronously (e.g. bounded FIFOs associated with event data ports). We enhance the original AGREE framework to align AGREE with the AADL timing and scheduling semantics. We use AGREE contracts to model the AADL port communication. We introduce virtual scheduling events, which tie the AADL semantics to the AGREE contracts. This enhancement enables AGREE to preserve the AADL semantics and take into account software schedule in the analysis. A preliminary version of the enhancement is demonstrated on a CASE project demonstration model.
