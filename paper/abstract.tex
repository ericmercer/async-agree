AGREE is an AADL-based compositional verification framework used in safety critical applications. It is based on a synchronous model of computation (instantaneous and simultaneous execution). This deviates from the AADL asynchronous semantics, where threads (mapped to a single processor) are executed in a sequential order (e.g. defined by a schedule) and communicate asynchronously (e.g. bounded FIFOs associated with event data ports). We extended the original AGREE framework to comply with the AADL semantics. We introduced virtual scheduling events in AADL, which tie the AADL timing and scheduling semantics to the AGREE contracts. This enhancement enables AGREE to preserve the AADL semantics and take into account software schedule in the analysis. This work was implementated and demonstrated in the DARPA CASE project.
