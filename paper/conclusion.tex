{\bf Discussion.}
The model of a schedule can be simplified to potentially improve the formal verification performance. The thread execution time can be modelled as just one tick. The idle time can be abstracted out. As long as the execution order is preserved, it is straightforward to show the proof/disproof is equavilent to a model directly mapping each base time unit to a tick.
