{\bf Conclusion.}
Based on the AGREE framework, we presented an approach to compositional verification of scheduled components. The proposed model of computation differs from the synchronous semantics used in current AGREE. We introduced the virtual scheduling events to tie AADL timing and execution semantics with AGREE contracts. The effectiveness of our apporach is demostrated in the DARPA CASE UAV model.

{\bf Future Work.}
In the proposed model, the queue associated with an AADL event port or event data port is limited to size of one. This limiation is driven by our domain of interest. We believe it is an interesting research direction to extend the modelling framework to allow a larger queue size, particularly for multi-rate dataflow-based applications. Given a \emph{balanced} static schedule, the maximum size of each queue is a constant that can be calculated. In general, the AADL scheduling tool Cheddar can be used to predict the maximum queue size. It is interesting to see how much complexity and performance penality that maintaining a queue would introduce.
